## Getting Started

1. Create a new Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com.
2. Add a new collection to the Firestore database with the name "login" to save admin logins with the following attributes:

   nativeId - This is a unique ID for each application, added as an extra security layer. Even if someone obtains admin passwords, they can't log in because their native ID is not authorized.

   username - Admin username ( you can use any )
   Password - Admin Password ( you can use any )

3.Build the application with Flutter & enjoy! ❤️
