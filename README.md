# FlutterTicketQR

A Flutter project for issuing, scanning, and managing tickets. Works with Google Firebase. The current name of the application is set to "Snowy Soiree," but you can use any name you want.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com.

2. Add a new collection to the Firestore database with the name "login" to save admin logins with the following attributes:

   nativeId - This is a unique ID for each application, added as an extra security layer. Even if someone obtains admin passwords, they can't log in because their native ID is not authorized.

   username - Admin username ( you can use any )
   Password - Admin Password ( you can use any )
   

3. Run 'flutter pub get' to install dependencies. Build the application with Flutter and enjoy! ❤️
